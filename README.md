# Sklearn Regression and Classification Experiments Repository

This Git repository comprises two Jupyter notebooks dedicated to running regression and classification algorithms using scikit-learn, along with the application of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. The repository also provides a `shap_requirements.txt` file listing the necessary dependencies for these experiments.

## 1. sklearnRegression_xai.ipynb

- **File:** `sklearn_linear_regression_xai.ipynb`
- This notebook focuses on regression tasks using scikit-learn. It runs the linear regression algorithm and then applies three XAI techniques: LIME, SHAP, and the DALEX XAI library. The goal is to provide insights and explanations for the regression model's predictions.

## 2. sklearn_classifier_xai.ipynb

- **File:** `sklearn_classifier_xai.ipynb`
- This notebook concentrates on classification tasks using scikit-learn. It runs various classification algorithms and then employs three XAI techniques: LIME, SHAP, and the DALEX XAI library. The notebook aims to interpret and explain the decisions made by the classification models.

## Getting Started

To replicate these experiments, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vtocitu365/sklearn_xai.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r shap_requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.

## Dependencies

The `shap_requirements.txt` file lists the dependencies required for these experiments. Ensure that these dependencies are installed before running the notebooks.
